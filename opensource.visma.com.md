**Introduction**

At Visma we truly believe that when creating the technology that will shape our future we are #bettertogether. That is why we as a company and our employees are happy to be part of the open source community. For us being part of the community means that we support and contribute a wide variety of open source projects, and actively participate in projects that we utilize to build our products and services. For our employees we encourage all to contribute to any open source project they like in any way they like regardless of their role or competence, developers may contribute with code, QAs with testing, tech-writers with documentation.
On this page you will find information about many of the projects we are contributing to both as a company and individuals that are part of the Visma family.
